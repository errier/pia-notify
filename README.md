# WebExtension

This WebExtension (Chrome extension/Firefox Add-on) will scrape the private internet access website to determine if your're protected or not.  
If not, it will temporarily show a warning on top of the page your're browsing.

This might be useful when you find privacy important and want a more in your face, but still subtle, warning that your VPN is down, for example:
* You have an OVPN client running on your router, so current VPN status is not easily visible.
* You hide your task bar / notification bar.
* You find the icons of the PIA apps too hard to read, or you forget about them every time.
